# BTS-power-density

The energy consumption of base transceiver stations (BTS) for the reported mobile data usage are calculated over the years for different Radio Access Technologies (RATâ€™s), 3G, 4G and 5G respectively. Simulation can be runfor dense and sub urban areas, rural area is not investigated as a typical rural area is difficult to define due to low population and coarse BTS coverage.
